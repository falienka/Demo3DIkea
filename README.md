# Demo 3D - Monika Åšwikszcz
Hej!

Thank you for visiting my repository. Here I have provided code for a 3D demo required for the technical interview at IKEA.

I have used Vite for packaging, so after copying the repository you need to run
```
npm run dev
```
in the terminal while being in ./Demo3DIkea ( the second one :smile: ) folder. If there are any problems feel free to contact me at mon.swikszcz@gmail.com .

Cheers!
